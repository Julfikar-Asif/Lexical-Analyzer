# Lexical Analyzer in C

This program implements a simple lexical analyzer in C that processes an input string, identifies tokens, and categorizes them into various types such as keywords, variables, operators, numbers, punctuation, and invalid tokens. It is useful for basic token analysis in programming language compilers.

# Features 

1. Identifies the following types of tokens:

    Keywords: Predefined reserved words like int, char, if, return, etc.
    Variables: Valid variable names starting with a letter or underscore (_), followed by alphanumeric characters or underscores.
    Operators: Mathematical and assignment operators like +, -, *, /, %, and =.
    Numbers: Integer or floating-point numbers with optional signs.
    Punctuation: Symbols like ;, ,, (), {}, etc.
    Invalid Tokens: Any unrecognized or improperly formatted token.
